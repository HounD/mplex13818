iso 13818 stream multiplexer
 
this multiplexer is designed to run uninterruptedly on a streaming server, that propagates a number of iso 13818 broadcast streams, reorganizing the streams in realtime. I wrote it in 2001 for convergence gmbh(http://www.convergence.de/), and they kindly released it finally as open source under the general public license (gpl http://www.fsf.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL) in 2003.

features:

    output is either a transport stream or a program stream
    input streams may be program streams, paketized elementary streams (PES) and transport stream, in any combination
    streams are kept in sync during multiplex, where possible
    normal real time operation obeys stream timing, but untimed operation is available for discfile conversion
    program information and stream compilation may be changed on the fly during operation
    program map table manipulation, descriptor filter/injection
    now includes an additional tool for EN 300468 SI table composition 


what this multiplexer does not:

    it does neither check, unpack nor recode elementary streams, it does not even care for what data it shovels: just bytes
    it does not check system performance capacities, so when the cpu cannot do the work, timing faults in the resulting stream may occur, even when running it in untimed mode 


installation:
unpacking the tar archive and "make install" will place it in the /usr/local sub hierarchy.
no readme file available, but man pages: iso13818ts(1), iso13818ps(1), repeatts(1), en300468ts(1)

there are additional diagnostic tools included: showts, ts2pes, pes2es. these are provided by third party, so i cannot explain details about them. the latter two are said to produce a nice stream dump when given the option -v. you are invited to write a man page or similar for these. otherwise check the sources for explanations.

for questions, feel free to ask. you may want to ask the experts at the linux-dvb mailing list(http://linuxtv.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/linux-dvb) at http://linuxtv.org, too.
